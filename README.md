# XY-model-Metropolis-Simulation

Python implementation of Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulation for XY-model. Implementation supports parrallelization via MPI, as well as some visualization fo 2D case. Presented results was obtained for $20 \times 20$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions and provide an opportunity to observe so called [Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosterlitz%E2%80%93Thouless_transition). 

Project for Scientific Computing course at Skoltech, autumn 2017.
